# React-portfolio

This project is a refactoring of our updated Bootstrap portfolio replication page. I took this opportunity to add a few personal touches, portfolio pieces as well as links to my LinkedIn and GitHub with React components. While this portfolio is closer to representing me as a person and a professional, I will continue to refine it until it is polished and interesting. 

For the time being, I took the opportunity to try my hand at some thematic color styling, and am fairly happy with the results. I also took advantages of media queries to do some interesting things on my landing page. 

I look forward to continuously updating and improving my portfolio site. 

## Credits 
This project was completed alone and represents an attempt toward a site more representative of my personal style.

## Challenges

I had trouble getting my background images to work properly and will have to revist it.
